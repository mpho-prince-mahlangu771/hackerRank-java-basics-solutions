# Date and time  Getting challenge


This challenge I decided to use the LocalDate class found in the time class because it's easier to work with compared to the calender class. Plus the time class is in java 11 which is what I'm currently learning

## Instructions 


You are given a date. You just need to write the method,getDay() , which returns the day on that date. 

## Example 

Month= 8 <br>
day=14 <br>
year=2017 <br>
<br>
The method should return MONDAY as the day on that date. 

## Returns

string: the day of the week in capital letters
