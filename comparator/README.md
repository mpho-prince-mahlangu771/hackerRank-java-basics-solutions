# Intoduction 

Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.
